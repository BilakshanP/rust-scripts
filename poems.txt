Money, power beauty or fame,
Choose your weapon to beat the game.

Money is power, art is fraud,
And love is just a drug from God.


Amid tears of sorrow
And a life of dread
I carry on today
With nothing in my head

But I'm trying, I am
I won't let hope die
Though the weight of the world
Makes it hard to get by

People talk, their lies
Can cut like a knife
But I stand here alone
On the edge of this life

I don't need them, no
Nor they, me I suppose
I'm here for a while
Till the day that I close

And when that day comes
They'll mourn and they'll cry
Fake tears of sadness
And of real dread inside

But I'll be gone, free
From the weight of it all
Finally at peace
As the final curtain falls


Sobriety is the reality
Being high is the truth

Though you are none
Still you would

The words mean no harm
Neither do they wish well

Wake up you butterfly
Don't let the spiders rule

One day you might fly
But that's not a promise

I can't assure you
Neither can God

Whether he exists
Or that it's all just a facade


No need to be kind,
If you won't mind.
Just leave me be,
Let me unwind.

In solitude, I find
My peace of mind,
Away from the grind
Of those left behind.

The noise and chatter
Just doesn't matter,
When my soul can scatter
And my thoughts can splatter.

In the canvas of my being,
I am always freeing
Myself from the seeing
Of those not agreeing.

So don't you worry,
If my path seems blurry.
I'll find my way, surely,
With my heart in no hurry.


Existence is pain,
And life is suffering,
I am stuck and,
My thoughts are buffering.

In the tapestry of existence's domain,
Where anguish whispers and sorrows reign,
I find myself ensnared, a soul adrift,
As my thoughts waltz, their rhythm shift.

Oh, the bittersweet symphony of life's toll,
Where pain weaves melodies within my soul,
In this vast tapestry, I stand entranced,
A captive of time, my essence enhanced.

For in the echoes of despair's refrain,
I wander through corridors of thought's domain,
The corridors where my musings roam,
Yet, alas, my mind, it stutters, it cannot fully comb.

Like a restless river with an impeded flow,
My thoughts cascade, yet their currents waver and slow,
Caught in the realm of a ceaseless buffering,
Where clarity eludes, in the depths I'm left suffering.

But within the shadows of my mind's plight,
I seek the ember of truth, an ethereal light,
For even in anguish's grip, wisdom may sprout,
A seed of resilience, amidst doubt and devout.

So I'll embrace this dance, the struggle profound,
In the realms of existence, where sorrows abound,
For it is through pain that growth may arise,
And from suffering's embrace, wisdom shall comprise.

In the tapestry of existence's embrace,
I'll find solace within the mysteries I chase,
And though my thoughts may falter, in their buffering strife,
I'll seek transcendence, the essence of life.



I don't like this life and I can't lie,
Even if I do even if I try,
It feels like a shrapnel piercing my eye.

I looked right and I looked left,
I tried everything but nothing was best,
I have felt everything bad and just waiting for the next.

The next thing to happen,
The experiences to sharpen,
More of my life to darken.

Dark as the night sky, without the stars without the moon,
Who would that be whom I could say, "See you soon."?

Life is like a curse, an epitome of bad luck,
Never do I care, I can only say "What the fuck"

So, this is where the poem ends,
And the rhyming may stop,
but nothing is greater than having some positive hope.


Oh Atlas, tell me what's heavier,
The burden of the world or a broken heart's tether?

Atlas, burdened by the weight of the sky,
Said, 'A broken heart, my friend, is heavier than high.'

For love's sorrow, though unseen, can crush,
The weight of emotions, in silence, we hush.

Yet, the world on my shoulders, I bear,
A celestial burden, vast and rare.

And still, in the tapestry of fate we're weaved,
Where love and duty, entwined, are believed.

In the dance of existence, we find our part,
A cosmic rhythm, a symphony of the heart.

So, ask not what's heavier, burden or art,
For life's essence lies in every beat, every start.



Hold my hands and let me make you mine, I promise everything would be alright, everything would be fine. Give our hearts to be together and shine. Let our souls intertwine. For the days to come and nights to pass, this is the verse I wrote for you, this is my last cry for love, this is my last line. So, would you like to be my valentine?

In clasped hands, our fates entwine,
Assured, every moment will be divine.
Surrender hearts, let love's radiance define,
In the tapestry of togetherness, we align.

Our souls, a dance in the moonlight's glow,
A timeless connection, only love can bestow.
Days to unfold, nights to serenely flow,
In this poetic vow, emotions beautifully grow.

With each verse penned, a plea so sincere,
Echoes of passion, crystal clear.
This ode to love, whispers we hold dear,
A symphony of emotions, drawing near.

As the sunsets fade, and the stars align,
This final verse, my valentine,
In love's embrace, let our spirits entwine,
Will you, dear heart, be forever mine?
